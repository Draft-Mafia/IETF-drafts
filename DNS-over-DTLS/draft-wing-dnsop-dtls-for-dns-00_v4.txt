Abstract

   DNS queries and responses are visible to network elements on the path
   between the DNS client and its server.  These queries and responses
   can contain privacy-sensitive information which is valuable to
   protect.  An active attacker can send bogus responses causing
   misdirection of the subsequent connection.

   To counter passive listening and active attacks, this document
   proposes the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for DNS,
   to protect against passive listeners and certain active attacks.  As
   DNS needs to remain fast, this proposal also discusses mechanisms to
   reduce DTLS round trips and reduce DTLS handshake size.  The proposed
   mechanism runs over the default DNS port and can also run over an
   alternate port.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System is specified in [RFC1034] and [RFC1035].  DNS
   queries and responses are normally exchanged unencrypted and are thus
   vulnerable to eavesdropping.  Such eavesdropping can result in an
   undesired entity learning domains that a host wishes to access, thus
   resulting in privacy leakage.  DNS privacy problem is further
   discussed in [I-D.bortzmeyer-dnsop-dns-privacy].

Internet-Draft                DNS over DTLS                   April 2014


   Active attackers have long been successful at injecting bogus
   responses, causing cache poisoning and causing misdirection of the
   subsequent connection (if attacking A or AAAA records).  A popular
   mitigation against that attack is to use ephemeral and random source
   ports for DNS queries.

   The mechanism described in this document provides confidential DNS
   communication for stub resolvers, recursive resolvers, iterative
   resolvers and authoritative servers.  The document only defines
   protocol extensions necessary to support DTLS negotiation.

2.  Relationship to DNSSEC

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC [RFC4033]) provides response
   integrity by defining mechanisms to cryptographically sign zones,
   allowing end-users (or their first-hop resolver) to verify replies
   are correct.  DNSSEC however does nothing to ensure DNS request or
   response privacy.  Authenticity and integrity may be provided by
   DNSSEC, DNS over DTLS does not change DNSSEC and does not offer the
   means to authenticate responses.  DNS over DTLS, however, does not
   preclude the use of DNSSEC.  Since, in some cases, encryption is
   opportunistic with the use of DNS over DTLS, a DNS client may opt for
   DNSSEC for security reasons.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

4.  Usage

   a.  DNS forwarder uses DNS over DTLS to communicate with ISP DNS
       resolver and thus offers confidentiality in the last mile even if
       the stub resolver does not support DNS over DTLS.

   b.  If a DNS resolver in an ISP does not support DNS over DTLS, the
       DNS forwarder or stub resolver can be configured to send DNS
       queries to DNS resolvers offered by public DNS servers.

5.  Polling, Port Usage, and Discovery

   [Note - This section requires further discussion]

   Many modern operating systems already detect if a web proxy is
   interfering with Internet communications, using proprietary
   mechanisms that are out of scope of this document.  After that
   mechanism has run (and detected Internet connectivity is working),



Reddy, et al.           Expires October 18, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                DNS over DTLS                   April 2014


   the DNS-over-DTLS procedure described in this document should
   commence.  This timing avoids delays in joining the network (and
   displaying an icon indicating successful Internet connection), at the
   risk that those initial DNS queries will be sent without protection
   afforded by DNS-over-DTLS.

   DNS-over-DTLS can run over standard UDP port 53 as defined in
   [RFC1035].  A DNS client or server that does not implement this
   specification will not respond to the incoming DTLS packets because
   they don't parse as DNS packets (the DNS Opcode would be 15, which is
   undefined).  A DNS client or server that does implement this
   specification can demultiplex DNS and DTLS packets by examining the
   third octet.  For TLS 1.2, which is what is defined by this
   specification, A DTLS packet will contain 253 in the third octet,
   whereas a DNS packet will never contain 253 in the third octet.

      Note: If this demultiplexing is useful, we should reserve DNS
      Opcode 15.

   There has been some concern with sending DTLS-over-DNS traffic over
   the same port as normal, un-encrypted DNS traffic.  The intent of
   this section is to show that DNS-over-DTLS could successfully be sent
   over port 53.  Further analysis and testing on the Internet may be
   valuable to determine if multiplexing on port 53, using a separate
   port, or some fallback between a separate port and port 53 brings the
   most success.

   After performing the above steps, the host should determine if the
   DNS server supports DNS-over-DTLS by sending a DTLS ClientHello
   message.  A DNS server that does not support DNS-over-DTLS will not
   respond to ClientHello messages sent by the client, because they are
   not valid DNS requests (specifically, the DNS Opcode is invalid).
   The client MUST use timer values defined in 4.2.4.1 of [RFC6347] for
   retransmission of ClientHello message and if no response is received
   from the DNS server.  After 15 seconds, it MUST cease attempts to re-
   transmit its ClientHello.  Thereafter, the client MAY repeat that
   procedure in the event the DNS server has been upgraded to support
   DNS over DTLS, but such probing SHOULD NOT be done more frequently
   than every 24 hours and MUST NOT be done more frequently than every
   15 minutes.  This mechnism requires no additional signaling between
   the client and server.

6.  In-Band Signaling

   An alternate mechanism is to signal support for DTLS in band.

   The authors have also briefly considered a DNS SRV query to ask if
   the DNS server supports DTLS-over-DNS such as



Reddy, et al.           Expires October 18, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                DNS over DTLS                   April 2014


   _dns_over_dtls._udp.well_known assuming "well_known" is defined as a
   special-use domain name [IANA-domain].  That query doesn't need to go
   beyond the DNS server itself.  An SRV query is suggested so the port
   can be returned (assuming SRV is ubiquitously available on clients?)

7.  Use by DNS clients

7.1.  Authenticating a DNS Server

   As DTLS provides integrity protection, some protection from on-path
   attackers sending bogus responses is provided by simply using DTLS.
   That is, a device on the path between a DNS client and its DNS server
   cannot simply inject a bogus DNS response, as could be done with
   normal DNS.  However, that protection is not terribly strong, because
   that attacker could intercept the DTLS handshake itself and pretend
   to be the actual DNS server.  To prevent that, we need to resolve two
   problems: identifying the trusted servers and determinnig an
   appropriate action when no trusted servers are available.

   The first problem, of identifying the legitimate server, requires
   extending the host configuration.  This is because DNS clients have
   their DNS servers configured by IP address (from DHCP or from a local
   configuration file such as /etc/resolv.conf), but certificates have a
   DNS name in the SubjectAltName field.  We can't change how
   certificates are issued, but we already have to modify the DNS client
   to support DNS-over-DTLS.  With that in mind, the DNS client would
   have a list of SubjectAltNames it trusts, configured by the user.
   That could be configured in the resolv.conf file itself, as shown
   below, or could be maintained in a separate file.

                  nameserver 192.0.2.1    dns.example.net
                  nameserver 198.51.100.1 dns.example.com


   The second problem is determining an appropriate action when no
   trusted servers are available.  Although the DNS client could still
   use DNS-over-DTLS with an un-trusted server which still provides
   protection from on-path passive listeners and from on- and off-path
   active attackers, this use does not protect from a malicious server
   returning bogus responses.  While DNSSEC can protect against bogus
   responses (lies), DNSSEC cannot protect against a server that simply
   does not return certain answers.

      [[Editor's Note: Is there more we could do?  Trust certain
      responses (like for my enterprise VPN or other sites where I will
      be doing a TLS handshake)?  Keep in mind that with web portals at
      hotels/airports, we won't have access to a trusted DNS server on
      initial connect at all.]]

7.2.  Sending Queries

   DNS clients MAY set the SO bit in queries sent using UDP transport to
   signal their general ability to support DNS over DTLS.  [For
   discussion: is this a bad idea because ignorant middleboxes might
   drop the SO=1 UDP queries?]

   DNS clients MAY set the SO bit in the initial query sent to a server
   using UDP transport to signal their desire that the UDP connection be
   upgraded to DTLS.  DNS clients MUST NOT set the SO bit on subsequent
   queries when already using DNS over DTLS.

   Since the motivation for DNS over DTLS is to preserve privacy, DNS
   clients SHOULD use a query that reveals no private information in the
   initial SO=1 query to a server.  To provide a standard "dummy" query,
   it is RECOMMENDED to send the initial query with RD=0,
   QNAME="STARTDTLS", QCLASS=CH, and QTYPE=TXT ("STARTDTLS/CH/TXT")
   analogous to administrative queries already in widespread use
   [RFC4892].

   After sending the initial SO=1 query using UDP transport, DNS clients
   MUST wait for the initial response before sending any subsequent
   queries over the same UDP connection.

7.3.  Receiving Responses

   A DNS client that receives a response using UDP transport that has
   the SO bit set MUST handle that response as usual.  It MAY record the
   server's support for DNS over DTLS and use that information as part
   of its server selection algorithm in the case where multiple servers
   are available to service a particular query.  [For discussion: UDP is
   subject to spoofing and a client which depends on SO=1 in a UDP
   response may be tricked into never upgrading to DTLS.]

   A DNS client that receives a response to its initial query using UDP
   transport that has the SO bit set MUST immediately initiate a DTLS
   handshake using the procedure described in [RFC6347].

   A DNS client that receives a response to its initial query using UDP
   transport that has the SO bit clear MUST not initiate a DTLS
   handshake and SHOULD utilize the existing UDP connection for
   subsequent queries.  DNS clients SHOULD remember server IP addresses
   that don't support DNS over DTLS and SHOULD NOT request DNS over DTLS
   from them for reasonable period.  (We suggest 1 hour, or when the
   client discovers a new resolver)

8.  Use by DNS Servers

Internet-Draft                DNS over DTLS                   April 2014


8.1.  Receving Queries

   A DNS server receiving a query over TCP MUST ignore the SO bit.

   A DNS server receiving a query over an existing DTLS session MUST
   ignore the SO bit.

   A DNS server receiving an initial query over UDP that has the SO bit
   set MAY inform the client it is willing to establish a DTLS session,
   as described in the next section.

   A DNS server receiving subsequent queries over a DTLS session MUST
   ignore the SO bit.

8.2.  Sending Responses

   A DNS server sending a response over UDP SHOULD set the SO bit to
   indicate its general support for DNS over DTLS, as long as it is
   willing and able to support a DTLS connection with the particular
   client.  A DNS server receiving an initial query over UDP that has
   the SO bit set MAY set the TO bit in its response.  The server MUST
   then proceed with the DTLS handshake protocol.  A DNS server
   receiving a "dummy" STARTDTLS/CH/TXT query over UDP MUST respond with
   RCODE=0 and a TXT RR in the Answer section.  Contents of the TXT RR
   are strictly informative (for humans) and MUST NOT be interpreted by
   the client software.  Recommended TXT RDATA values are "STARTDTLS" or
   "NO_DTLS".

9.  Established sessions

   In DTLS, all data is protected using the same record encoding and
   mechanisms.  When the mechanism described in this document is in
   effect, DNS messages are encrypted using the standard DTLS record
   encoding.  When a user of DTLS wishes to send an DNS message, it
   delivers it to the DTLS implementation as an ordinary application
   data write (e.g., SSL_write()).  A single DTLS session can be used to
   receive multiple DNS requests and generate DNS multiple responses.

10.  Performance Considerations

   To reduce number of octets of the DTLS handshake, especially the
   certificate sent by the server, we should examine viability of using
   plain public keys [I-D.ietf-tls-oob-pubkey].  As the client already
   needs explicit configuration in a whitelist of the DNS servers it
   trusts, maybe the public key configuration problem is really no worse
   than the configuration problem of those whitelisted certificates?

   With normal DNS over UDP, the server maintains no state between
   queries.  To keep the server state similarly low between queries, the
   client can store the DTLS security association if both client and
   server implement [RFC5077].

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new bit ("SO") in the Flags field of the
   EDNS0 OPT meta-RR.  At the time of approval of this draft in the
   standards track, as per the IANA Considerations of [RFC6891], IANA is
   requested to reserve the third leftmost bit of the flags as the SO
   bit, immediately adjacent to the DNSSEC SO bit, as shown in
   Section 6.
