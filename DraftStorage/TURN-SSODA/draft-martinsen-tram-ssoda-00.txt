                Single SOcket Dual Allocation with TURN
                     draft-martinsen-tram-ssoda-00

Abstract

   This draft describes a simple method for allocating on IPv4 and one
   IPv6 RELAY address by sending one allocate request to the TURN
   server.  This saves local port on the agent and reduces the number of
   messages sent between the agent and the TURN server.

1.  Introduction

   The main motivation for this draft is to reduce the number of open
   local ports on the agent and reduce the number of messages that needs
   to me exchanged to allocate the RELAY addresses an agent needs.

   Reducing the number of local ports is important as it saves resources
   at three places in the network.  First locally at the host itself.
   Secondly at the NAT.  With fewer local host ports there will be fewer
   NAT binding for the NAT to keep track of.  And at last it reduces the
   number of open ports the TURN server needs to open on the interface
   towards the agent (Private side).  As ports are a scarce resource
   (16bit number) preserving them on the NAT and a the TURN server can
   potentially lead to easier large scale deployments.

2.  Creating an Allocation

   The behavior specified here affects the processing defined in
   Section 6 of [RFC5766] and Section 4 of [RFC6156].

2.1.  Sending an Allocate Request

   A client that wishes to obtain one IPv6 and one IPv4 by sending one
   Allocate request MUST include two REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY
   attributes, one for each address family, in the Allocate request that
   it sends to the TURN server.  The mechanisms to formulate an Allocate
   request are described in Section 6.1 of [RFC5766].

   Clients MUST NOT include a REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute in an
   Allocate request that contains a RESERVATION-TOKEN attribute.  [[Q2:
   Or should we disallow the whole odd even port scheme when this
   mechanism is in use?  Will simplify things on the server.
   --palmarti]]

2.2.  Receiving an Allocate Request

   Once a server has verified that the request is authenticated and has
   not been tampered with, the TURN server processes the Allocate
   request following the rules in [RFC5766] and [RFC6156].  Only one
   REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute with the same family value is
   allowed in the request.  If two attributes with the same family value
   exist the server MUST ignore all but one.

   If the server can successfully process the request, it allocates a
   RELAY address for each of the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes in
   the Allocate request.  The allocated RELAY addresses are returned in
   separate XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attributes in the Allocate response
   message.

   If the requested address family is not supported on the TURN server,
   a XOR-ADDRESS-ATTRIBUTE with a NULL address corresponding to the
   address family not allocated MUST be included in the response.  This
   will notify the client that the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY was
   understood, but not supported.

   If the REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes are absent, the server
   MUST allocate an IPv4-relayed transport address for the TURN client.
   If allocation of IPv4 addresses is disabled by local policy, the
   server returns a 440 (Address Family not Supported) Allocate error
   response.

2.3.  Receiving an Allocate Success Response

   If the client receives a Allocate Response containing a XOR-RELAYED-
   ADDRESS attribute for each of the corresponding REQUESTED-ADDRESS-
   FAMILY attributes in the Allocate request sent by the client, the
   client knows that the TURN server supports multiple address family
   allocation over a single socket.  The RELAY addresses can now be used
   by the client.

   If the Allocate response contains at least one XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS
   and at least one REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attribute, the client know
   that the TURN server supports SSODA, and the allocated RELAY
   addresses can be used.  The client MUST not try to allocate any of
   the included requested address families on a different 5-tuple.

   If the Allocate Response contain one XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS attribute
   and no additional REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes the client
   knows that the TURN server does not support SSODA.  The client can
   retry the the missing address family allocations on new 5-tuples
   (from a new local HOST address).  Subsequent Allocate Request towards
   the same TURN server MUST not include multiple REQUESTED-ADDRESS-
   FAMILY attributes.

2.4.  Receiving an Allocate Error Response

   If the client receives an Allocate error response with the 440
   (Unsupported Address Family) error code, the client knows that the
   TURN server does not SSODA and might have misinterpreted any of the
   included REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes in the Allocate request.
   The client should retry the allocations by sending the Allocate
   request messages from different local HOST ports and without
   including multiple REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes.

3.  Refreshing an Allocation

   The behavior specified here affects the processing defined in
   Section 7 of [RFC5766] and Section 5 of [RFC6156].  This section MUST
   only be used if the client have verified that the TURN server
   supports SSODA during the allocation creation described in
   Section 2.1.  Otherwise rewert back to 5766 behaviour.

3.1.  Sending a Refresh Request

   To perform an allocation refresh, the client generates a Refresh
   Request as described in Section 7.1 of [RFC5766].  The client MUST
   include one ore more REQUESTED-ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes describing
   the the family types that should be refreshed.

   If the clients wants to delete an existing allocation of a specific
   address type the lifetime of that refresh request must be set to 0
   and requested address type must be included.  It is possible to
   delete one ore more allocations dependant on how many REQUESTED-
   ADDRESS-FAMILY attributes that are included.

3.2.  Receiving a Refresh Request

   The server refreshes the allocated address families that matches the
   requested address family value.  If some of the values in the request
   do not match an allocated family this is silently ignored.  (No point
   in refreshing or deleting an allocation that does not exist.)

   If a server receives a Refresh Request with REQUESTED-ADDRESS- FAMILY
   attributes, and none attributes values don't match any of the address
   family allocations, the server MUST reply with a 443 (Peer Address
   Family Mismatch) Refresh error response.

3.3.  CreatePermission

   The behavior specified here affects the processing defined in
   Section 9 of [RFC5766] and Section 6 of [RFC6156]

3.3.1.  Sending a CreatePermission Request

   The client MUST only include XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attributes with
   addresses of the same address family as that of the relayed transport
   addresses that are allocated.

3.3.2.  Receiving a CreatePermission Request

   If an XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute contains an address of an address
   family different than that any of the relayed transport addresses
   allocated, the server MUST generate an error response with the 443
   (Peer Address Family Mismatch) response code, which is defined in
   Section 6.2.1 of [RFC6156].

4.  Channels

   [[Q3: Allow to bind two channels?  Or only bind one and discard the
   other address types?  --palmarti]]

   direction and insight.
