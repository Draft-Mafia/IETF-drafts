             In-band Media PRopErties Signalling with STUN
                       draft-martinsen-impress-00

Abstract

   It can be useful for applications to provide some limited information
   regarding the properties of the data the application is sending.
   Such properties can be used by on-path devices to give the
   application a better user experience.  It is also useful for the
   application to know the current status of the on-path devices
   (Network).  If the application knows that the network path is
   congested, it can take appropriate action to not make the situation
   any worse.

   This draft describes how this can be achieved by adding two small
   attributes to any STUN packet sent by the application.  For example;
   such STUN packets are sent during call setup when ICE connectivity
   checks er performed or when the call is established in keep-alive
   messages.  The application and devices on the media path can use the
   information in the two STUN attributes to prioritize the flow,
   perform traffic engineering, or provide network analytics.

   This STUN attributes in this draft are on purpose small and strictly
   specified.  This is to avoid unnecessary information leakage and
   other security concerns regarding growing the size of the STUN
   message.  The functionality described here is referred to as IMPRESS.

1.  Introduction

   In the context of Content, Mobile, Fixed Service, Service Providers,
   Enterprise and Private networks have a need to prioritize packet
   flows end-to-end.  These flows are often dynamic, time-bound,
   encrypted, peer-to-peer, possibly asymmetric, and might have
   different priorities depending on network conditions, direction, time
   of the day, dynamic user preferences and other factors.  These
   factors may be time variant, and thus need to be signalled.
   Moreover, in many cases of peer-to-peer communication, flow
   information is known only to the endpoint.  These considerations,
   coupled with the trend to use encryption for browser-to-browser
   communication [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch], imply that access
   lists, deep packet inspection and other static prioritization methods
   cannot be employed successfully to prioritize packet flows.  This
   specification describes how these problems can be solved by using
   defining two strictly defined STUN [RFC5389] attributes which can be
   added to any STUN message the client wants to send.  STUN messages
   are typically sent during the ICE [RFC5245] connectivity check phase
   when the media session is established, or when keep-alive STUN
   messages are sent after the session is established.  The application
   is not limited to those two scenarios, if some communication between
   application and network is needed it can choose to do so at any time.

   Devices on the media path can use the information in the STUN
   attributes to prioritize the flow, perform traffic engineering, or
   provide network analytics.  Applications can use information in
   network status attribute to influence rate stating points or rate
   adaption mechanisms.

   This document describes a mechanism for how such application
   properties and network status can be sent by STUN.  The functionality
   described here is referred to as IMPRESS.  Due to the security
   implications described in (TODO: Ref Martins draft) where large STUN
   packet are used amplify an attack, keeping the added STUN attributes
   is an important design consideration.  To avoid unwanted information
   leakage the two defined attributes STREAM_PROPERTIES and
   NETWORK_STATUS are strictly defined in this draft.

2.  General Usage

   This draft defines several attributes that can be added to a STUN
   message; STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, DELAY-TOLERANCE, LOSS-
   TOLERANCE and NETWORK-STATUS.  Se Section 6 for the formal
   description.  It is RECOMMENDED to add them to a STUN request
   response pair, especially if the NETWORK STATUS attribute is in use.

   The STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, DELAY-TOLERANCE, LOSS-TOLERANCE
   attributes MUST be added before any INTEGRITY attribute.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to only add this attribute to STUN messages containing a
   INTEGRITY attribute as this prevents tampering with the content of
   the attribute.

   If the client wants to receive feedback from the network it must add
   a empty NETWORK-STATUS attribute.  This attribute MUST be added after
   the INTEGRITY attribute, as on-path devices will write information
   into this attribute.  Having a readily available attribute to write
   into will save the the on-path device from growing buffers to add
   their own attribute.  On path devices SHOULD not add their own
   NETWORK-STATUS attribute.

   If an agent receives a STUN request with a NETWORK-STATUS attribute
   after the INTEGRITY attribute, it should copy the content into a new
   NETWORK-STATUS attribute and add it before the INTEGRITY attribute
   when sending the STUN response.  A new empty NETWORK-STATUS attribute
   can be added after the INTEGRITY attribute.  New STEAM-PROPERTIES
   attributes can also be added describing the stream in this direction.

   If an agent receives a STUN response with a NETWORK-STATUS attribute
   before the INTEGRITY attribute, this describes the stream in the
   upstream direction.  A NETWORK-STATUS attribute after the INTEGRITY
   attribute describes the stream in the downstream direction.

   It might make sense to distinguish IMPRESS packets from normal STUN
   packets.  This would prevent unnecessary processing of normal STUN
   packets on the network nodes.

   A few alternatives (Needs discussion):

   1.  Alter the STUN magic cookie.  (But than i would not be a STUN
       packet anymore, and that raises a new set of problems)

   2.  Add a special this is IMPRESS attribute.  This must be the first
       attribute in the message.  This allows for network node to look
       for IMPRESS packets at a fixed offset without needing to parse
       the entire packet.

   3.  Alter the transaction id.  This might be problematic if using it
       in conjunction with ICE connectivity checks.  But probably fine
       in other scenarios.

   4.  Define a new STUN Method.  Also brakes ICE, makes it harder to
       tag onto attributes to already in use messages.

   [[Q1: Do we want to restrict this to req/resp or do we want to allow
   for the attributes to be added in this fashion for indications as
   well? --palmarti]]

                           IMPRESS example flow

   1.  Alice creates a Binding Request, adds STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-
       USAGE, DELAY-TOLERANCE, LOSS-TOLERANCE attributes before the
       INTEGRITY attribute and a single NETWORK-STATUS attribute after
       the INTEGRITY attribute.

   2.  Router1 inspects the STUN Request message and reads any STREAM-
       TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, DELAY-TOLERANCE or LOSS-TOLERANCE
       attributes and the information they contain.  It then updates the
       NETWORK-STATUS attribute with any information the router have.
       It then forwards the request.

   3.  Bob processes the STUN Request.  When Bob builds the response, it
       copies the NETWORK-STATUS attribute into the STUN Response before
       the INTEGRITY check and adds new empty NETWORK-STATUS attribute
       after the INTEGRITY attribute.  Bob then transmits the message.

   4.  Router2 (first IMPRESS network element for the downstream
       direction) inspects the Response message, reads the STREAM-TYPE,
       BANDWIDTH-USAGE, DELAY-TOLERANCE or LOSS-TOLERANCE attributes and
       MAY alter the NETWORK-STATUS attribute located after the
       INTEGRITY attribute.  It then transmits the message.

   5.  When Alice receives the STUN Response, she can extract the
       STREAM-TYPE, BANDWIDTH-USAGE, DELAY-TOLERANCE or LOSS-TOLERANCE
       attributes and the two NETWORK-STATUS attributes to get a
       complete picture of what the remote agent is sending and how the
       status of both the upstream and downstream path.

3.  Interaction with ICE

   An ICE connectivity check is performed by sending a STUN Binding
   indication.  Prior to sending the agent can add one STREAM-TYPE
   attribute.  If added, only one MUST be added.  This is to avoid
   unnecessary large STUN packets during the connectivity checks.  If
   the connectivity check is sent on a 5-tuple that multiplexes
   different types of media and more detailed information wants to be
   signalled it should be done after the connectivity check phase is
   finished.

   This limits the information the STUN messages are able to convey
   during the connectivity checks, but also avoids adding network
   confution with BANDWIDTH-USAGE attributes describing different paths
   that never going to be utilized.

   [[Q2: Problem with consent freshness if not based on STUN.
   --palmarti]]

4.  Multiplexed streams

   TODO: Write.  Explain in detail what options you have with
   multiplexed streams.  If not used in conn checks you can add more
   than one attribute.

5.  Network Processing

   TODO: Write properly.  Update the node cont field.  Only update other
   fields if they are worse than what is already there (Aggregated
   result).  Values are only hints, no promises.  Will not describe
   algorithm to calculate congestion value.  But values close to MAX may
   lead to applications rate adoption mechanisms to kick in.  (Fairness
   problem)

   TODO: Describe interaction with DSCP.  The rtcweb-qos documents
   explicitly says how to map for instance video to a DSCP value.  If
   the DSCP values was somehow reset on the path (That happens) the
   router can remark the IP packets correctly by looking at the STUN
   message.  (IE the signalling in the STUN message survives the whole
   path, and is integrity protects, but the network node have no way of
   detecting that...)

6.  New STUN attributes

   This STUN extension defines the following new attributes:

         0xXXX0: STREAM-TYPE
         0xXXX1: BANDWIDTH-USAGE
         0xXXX2: DELAY-TOLERANCE
         0xXXX3: LOSS-TOLERANCE
         0xYYYY: NETWORK STATUS

6.1.  STREAM-TYPE

   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (32) so no
   padding is necessary.

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              TYPE             |         TBD                   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                      Figure 1: STREAM TYPE Attribute

   TYPE:  STREAM TYPE a a 16 bit value defined in below describing the
      flow.

   There are four stream types types defined:

        0x0001 Undescribed
        0x0002 Audio
        0x0004 Video
        0x0008 Application Data

                          Figure 2: STREAM Types

   The intention is to keep the number of types limited and general.
   (Avoiding descriptions like high quality and similar that change over
   time)

   It is possible to combine the stream types if a stream contains more
   than one type.

   If a 5-tuple is used to send both a audio and video stream, the
   stream type can be set to 0x0006.  This can be useful if the
   application wants to hint that the 5-tuple contains several streams,
   This is useful if the attribute is added to STUN binding requests
   during ICE connectivity checks.  If more information regarding
   multiplexed streams is needed it is possible to add more than one
   attribute to a STUN message (See section ??).  This can be done to
   STUN messages that are being sent after the connectivity check phase
   is finished (Keepalive, consent freshness).  During this phase the
   added size of the STUN messages pose no security threat.

6.2.  BANDWIDTH-USAGE

   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (32) so no
   padding is necessary.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |            SUSTAINED (kbps)   |           MAX (kbps)          |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                    Figure 3: BANDWIDTH USAGE Attribute

   SUSTAINED:  Expected sustained bandwidth usage for this stream.  Note
      that for elastic types of streams like video, sudden large
      movements in the picture my lead to this value being inaccurate.

   MAX:  The maximum bandwidth usage for this stream.  If the sustained
      and max value differ greatly it might be safe to assume that an
      elastic encoder is in use.  (Would it be useful to say something
      about expected BURST lengths?)

6.3.  DELAY-TOLERANCE

   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (32) so no
   padding is necessary.

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |       Loss of Quality (ms)    |       Loss of Service (ms)    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                   Figure 4: DELAY TOLLERANCE Attribute

   Loss of Quality:  Amount of delay in ms the streams can accept on the
      entire path without experiencing quality issues.

   Loss of Service:  Amount of delay in ms on the entire path the
      without the service being unusable.

   Wanted to avoid terms like high/low delay tolerance and replace them
   with real numbers.  But in the end the network elements will probably
   decide what queue they go into based on these values.

   If an agent have two video streams, one for live video and one for
   slide sharing.  The video for the presentation sharing have much
   higher delay tolerances.

   Incentives to lie about the values.  The network element can treat
   those values as internal prioritization for the streams coming out
   from particular agent or session.  (But then we need to group them
   together.  MSID in STUN packets?)

6.4.  LOSS-TOLERANCE

   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (32) so no
   padding is necessary.

       0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                    Figure 5: LOSS TOLLERANCE Attribute

   Loss of Quality:  Amount of packet loss in percentage the streams can
      accept on the entire path without experiencing quality issues.

   Loss of Service:  Amount of packet loss in percentage on the entire
      path the without the service being unusable.

   If an agent have two video streams, one for live video and one for
   slide sharing.  The video for the presentation sharing have much
   higher loss tolerances.

   Incentives to lie about the values.  The network element can treat
   those values as internal prioritization for the streams coming out
   from particular agent or session.  (But then we need to group them
   together.  MSID in STUN packets?)

6.5.  NETWORK STATUS

   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (32) so no
   padding is necessary.

   This attribute MUST be added after any INTEGRITY attribute in the
   STUN message.  Values in this attribute can be updated along the
   network path by nodes that are not able to regenerate a correct
   INTEGRITY attribute.

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                    Figure 6: NETWORK STATUS Attribute

   Conguestion Lvl:  Value in the range 0x00 and Ox0F describing the
      level of congestion the network element is experiencing at this
      point. 0x00 means no congestion, 0x0F Fully congested.  The router
      can choose any value between those value as it sees fit.  The
      application that sees those values might act on by doing some rate
      adaption or similar.  The values 0x10-0xFF are reserved for future
      use.

   Node Cnt:  Numbers of nodes that supports IMPRESS in the notwork
      path.  Any router on the path that understands IMPRESS should
      increase this number.
