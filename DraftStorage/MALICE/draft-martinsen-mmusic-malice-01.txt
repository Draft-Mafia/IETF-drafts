                Meta-data Attribute signaLling with ICE
                    draft-martinsen-mmusic-malice-01

Abstract

   It can be useful for applications to provide flow metadata
   information to on-path devices to influence flow treatment in the
   network.  Provided that the network is able to provide useful
   feedback, this can also influence path selection if an application
   have multiple flow paths to choose from.

   This draft describes how this can be achieved by adding metadata to
   the STUN packets sent during the ICE connectivity checks or a
   slightly modified version of the keep-alive mechanism.  Devices on
   the media path can use the metadata information to prioritize the
   flow, perform traffic engineering, or provide network analytics and
   notifications as requested by the endpoints.  On-path devices can
   append or modify the existing metadata information in the STUN/ICE
   messages to enable feedback to other on-path devices or the
   applications in both ends of the media session.

   This document describes a framework mechanism for how such metadata
   can be transported by STUN when ICE is in use and it covers the
   endpoint and on path device processing.  The functionality described
   here is referred to as MALICE.

1.  Problem Statement

   In the context of Content, Mobile, Fixed Service, Service Providers,
   Enterprise and Private networks have a need to prioritize packet
   flows end-to-end.  These flows are often dynamic, time-bound,
   encrypted, peer-to-peer, possibly asymmetric, and might have
   different priorities depending on network conditions, direction, time
   of the day, dynamic user preferences and other factors.  These
   factors may be time variant, and thus need to be signalled.
   Moreover, in many cases of peer-to-peer communication, flow
   information is known only to the endpoint.  These considerations,
   coupled with the trend to use encryption for browser-to-browser
   communication [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch], imply that access
   lists, deep packet inspection and other static prioritization methods
   cannot be employed successfully to prioritize packet flows.  It can
   also be useful for the endpoints to provide flow metadata and receive
   network feedback in order select an optimal media communication path.
   This specification describes how these problems can be solved at

   different points in the network by using either STUN [RFC5389]
   packets sent during ICE's [RFC5245] connectivity check phase during
   establishment of a media session, or as part a slightly modified
   keep-alive mechanism after the session is established.  Devices on
   the media path can use the metadata information to prioritize the
   flow, perform traffic engineering, or provide network analytics and
   notifications as requested by the endpoints.  On-path devices can
   append or modify the existing metadata information in the STUN/ICE
   messages.  The ICE agents may use this information to learn about the
   status of their requests at on-path devices.

   This document describes a framework mechanism for how such metadata
   can be transported by STUN when ICE is in use with UDP based media
   and it covers the endpoint and middlebox processing.  The
   functionality described here is referred to as MALICE.
