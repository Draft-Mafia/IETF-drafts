Abstract

   It can be useful for applications to provide flow metadata
   information to on-path devices to influence flow treatment in the
   network.

   This draft describes how this can be achieved by adding metadata to
   the STUN packets sent during the ICE connectivity checks or keep-
   alive messages.  Devices on the media path can use the metadata
   information to prioritize the flow, perform traffic engineering, or
   provide network analytics.

   This document describes a mechanism for how such metadata can be
   transported by STUN when ICE is in use.  The functionality described
   here is referred to as MALICE.

1.  Introduction

   In the context of Content, Mobile, Fixed Service, Service Providers,
   Enterprise and Private networks have a need to prioritize packet
   flows end-to-end.  These flows are often dynamic, time-bound,
   encrypted, peer-to-peer, possibly asymmetric, and might have
   different priorities depending on network conditions, direction, time
   of the day, dynamic user preferences and other factors.  These
   factors may be time variant, and thus need to be signalled.
   Moreover, in many cases of peer-to-peer communication, flow
   information is known only to the endpoint.  These considerations,
   coupled with the trend to use encryption for browser-to-browser
   communication [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch], imply that access
   lists, deep packet inspection and other static prioritization methods
   cannot be employed successfully to prioritize packet flows.  This
   specification describes how these problems can be solved by using
   either STUN [RFC5389] packets sent during ICE's [RFC5245]
   connectivity check phase during establishment of a media session, or
   keep-alive mechanism after the session is established.  Devices on
   the media path can use the metadata information to prioritize the
   flow, perform traffic engineering, or provide network analytics.

   This document describes a mechanism for how such metadata can be sent
   by STUN when ICE is in use with UDP based media.  The functionality
   described here is referred to as MALICE.  Due to the security
   implications described in (Martins draft) where large STUN packet are
   used amplify the attack, an decision consideration in MALICE is to
   keep the message size small.

   The META-DATA sent should be treated as informational by the network.
   No mechanisms for sending feedback from the network to the
   application are described in this document.

2.  Sending Meta-data

   An application using ICE to negotiate the end to end media-path can
   add meta when sending the necessary STUN probing or keep-alive
   messages.  Several Meta-data attributes can be added to a STUN
   message.  This is especially useful in multiplexing scenarios such as
   BUNDLE where several media streams are sent on the same 5-tuple.

2.1.  Adding Meta-data to connectivity cheks

   An ICE connectivity check is performed by sending a STUN Binding
   request.  Prior to sending the agent can add one or more meta-data
   attributes to the Binding Request.  Values in the Meta-data attribute
   are usually default values configured by the agent.

   An agent receiving STUN Binding requests with Meta-Data attributes
   can successfully use that information to set up for example audio or
   video decoders.

   Meta-data can also be added to the STUN Binding Responses.  This will
   let the remote side know that the Meta-data was transported end-to-
   end on the path.  Meta data SHOULD not be added to a response message
   unless Meta-data attributes was added to the corresponding Binding
   Request.

2.2.  Adding Meta-data to keepalive messages

   An ICE connectivity check is performed by sending a STUN Binding
   indication.  Prior to sending the agent can add one or more meta-data
   attributes to the Binding Indication.  Values in the Meta-data
   attribute should reflect what is send in the stream at this point in
   time.

   Problem with concent freshness if not based on STUN.

3.  New STUN attribute

   This STUN extension defines the following new attribute:

      0xXXXX: META-DATA


   This attribute have a length that are multiples of 4 (96) so no
   padding is necessary.

                       Figure 1: META-DATA Attribute

   META-DATA TYPE a a 16 bit value defined in section ?? describing the
   flow.  The next 16 bits MUST be a number describing the approximate
   bandwidth usage in kbps.  If this is unknown the value 0x0 is used.
   The rest of the 64 bits of the attribute is reserved for further
   description of the specific META-DATA type.  This value field is thus
   dependant on the type field and entities not understanding the
   specific META-DATA type should ignore this when parsing.

   max retransmits:  Maximal number of retransmits a client will do
      before giving up.  For example a normal STUN transactions have 10
      retransmits before it is considered as failed.  RTP will typically
      have 0 retransmits.

   retransmits:  Current number of retransmits for non reliable packets
      in this stream.  If this number is close to the mac retransmits it
      might be nice of the network element to concider not to drop the
      next packets coming.

   Bandwidth:  Bandwidth usage with video encoders are elastic.  This
      value should indicate what max bandwidth value the encoder are set
      up to use.  Dependant on movement in the picture and other video
      specific parameters the actual bandwidth usage might be lower than
      indicated.  Note that this value can change over time as rate
      adaption algorithms in the encoder might change this value.

   Vertical Resolution:  Current vertical resolution used in the video
      encoded in the stream.  Note that this value might change over
      time as the encoder might change this dependant on many different
      parameters.  (In some instances a encoder can decide that changing
      from 1080p30 to 720p60 will give the end user a better user
      experience)

   Horizontal Resolution:  Current horizontal resolution.

   FPS:  How many frames per seconds the video in the stream is encoded
      with.
