  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">When moving between networks, an endpoint has to change its IP address. This change breaks upper layer protocols such as TCP and RTP.  Various techniques exist to prevent this breakage, all tied to making the endpoint's IP address static (e.g., Mobile IP, Proxy Mobile IP, LISP). Other techniques exist, which make the upper layer protocol ambivalent to IP address changes (e.g., SCTP). The mechanisms described in this document are in that last category.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">ICE <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a> ensures two endpoints have a working media path between them, and is typically used by Internet-connected interactive media systems (e.g., SIP endpoints). ICE does not expect either the local host or the remote host to change their IP addresses. Although ICE does allow an "ICE restart", this is done by sending a re-INVITE which goes over the SIP signaling path. The SIP signaling path is often slower than the media path (which needs to be recovered as quickly as possible), consumes an extra half round trip, and incurs an additional delay if the mobility event forces the endpoint to re-connect with its SIP proxy. When a device changes its IP address, it is necessary for it to re-establish connectivity with its SIP proxy, which can be performed in parallel with the steps described in this document. This document describes how mobility is performed entirely in the media path, without the additional delay of re-establishing SIP connectivity, issuing a new offer/answer, or the complications of multiple SIP offers. This document considers re-establishing bi-directional media the most critical aspect of a successful mobility event, and its efforts are towards meeting that goal.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">A TURN <a href="#RFC5766">[RFC5766]</a> server relays media packets and is used for a variety of purposes, including overcoming NAT and firewall traversal issues and IP address privacy. The existing TURN specification does not allow the client address to change, especially if multiple clients share the same TURN username (e.g., the same credentials are used on multiple devices).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This document proposes two mechanisms to achieve RTP mobility: a mechanism where both endpoints support MICE, and a mechanism where only one endpoint supports MICE. When both endpoints support MICE, ICE itself can be used to provide mobility. When only one endpoint supports MICE, a TURN server provides mobility. Both mobility techniques work across and between network types (e.g., between 3G and wired Internet access), so long as the client can still access the remote ICE peer or TURN server.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">When both endpoints support ICE, ICE itself can provide mobility functions. One of the primary aspects of ICE is its address gathering, wherein ICE has each endpoint determine all of the IP addresses and ports that might be usable for that endpoint and communicate that list of addresses and ports to its peer, usually over SDP. That enables the next primary aspect of ICE, which is its connectivity checks: each ICE endpoint sends a connectivity check from a checklist created by the local and remote candidates exchanged in the initial offer/answer exchange. When the ICE endpoint checks the mapped address from the STUN response during ICE connectivity checks and finds that the transport address does not match any of the local candidates that the ICE agent knows about, the mapped address represents a new candidate -- a peer reflexive candidate. This will cause the endpoint to construct a new pair and insert it into the local checklist (Section 7.2.1.3 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>). ICE Mobility (MICE) takes advantage of that existing ICE functionality to provide faster mobility.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">Endpoints that support ICE Mobility perform ICE normally, and MUST also include the MOBILITY-SUPPORT attribute in all of their STUN requests and their STUN responses. The inclusion of this attribute allows the ICE peer to determine if it can achieve mobility using ICE or needs to use TURN. To force the use of TURN to achieve ICE mobility, the ICE endpoint SHOULD NOT respond to ICE connectivity checks that have an IP address and port different from the TURN server, unless those connectivity checks contain the MOBILITY-SUPPORT attribute. In this way, the remote peer will think those other candidates are invalid (because its connectivity checks did not succeed).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">After concluding ICE and moving to the ICE completed state (see Section 8 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>) either endpoint or both endpoints can initiate ICE Mobility, no matter if it was the Controlling Agent or the Controlled Agent during normal ICE processing.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">When the interface currently being used for communication becomes unavailable then ICE agent acquires a list of interfaces that are available and based on the locally configured host policy preferences, the ICE endpoint performs ICE Mobility using one of the available interfaces. In this case local candidates from the selected interface are not present in the valid list. ICE Mobility is performed by:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>The ICE agent remembers the remote host/server reflexive/peer reflexive candidates for each component of the media streams previously used from the valid list before clearing its ICE check list and ICE Valid List.</li>
  <li>The ICE endpoint gathers host candidates of the same address family as the remote peer on the new interface, forms a check list by creating candidate pairs with local host candidates and remote host/server-reflexive candidates collected in step 1, performs "Computing Pair Priority and Ordering Pairs" (Section 5.7.2 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>), "Pruning the Pairs" (Section 5.7.3 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, "Computing states" (Section 5.7.4 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>).</li>
  <li>The ICE endpoint initiates ICE connectivity checks on those candidates from the check list in the previous step, and includes the MOBILITY-EVENT attribute in those connectivity checks.</li>
  <li>The ICE endpoint acts as controlling agent and the ICE connectivity check from the previous step SHOULD also include the USE-CANDIDATE attribute to signal an aggressive nomination (see Section 2.6 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>).</li>
  <li>The ICE endpoint performs "Discovering Peer Reflexive Candidates" (Section 7.1.3.2.1 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>), "Constructing a Valid Pair" (Section 7.1.3.2.2 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>), "Updating Pair States" (Section 7.1.3.2.3 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>), and "Updating the Nominated Flag" (Section 7.1.3.2.4 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>). When the valid list contains a candidate pair for each component then ICE processing is considered complete for the media stream and ICE agent can start sending media using the nominated candidate pair.</li>
  <li>Once ICE connectivity checks for all of the media streams are completed, the controlling ICE endpoint follows the procedures in Section 11.1 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, specifically to send updated offer if the candidates in the m and c lines for the media stream (called the DEFAULT CANDIDATES) do not match ICE's SELECTED CANDIDATES (also see Appendix B.9 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">The ICE endpoint even after Mobility using ICE is successful can issue an updated offer indicating ICE restart if connectivity checks using higher priority candidate pairs are not successful.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.4">Mobility using ICE could fail in case of Simultaneous Mobility or if the ICE peer is behind NAT that performs Address-Dependent Filtering (see Section 5 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>). Hence the ICE endpoint in parallel will re-establish connection with the SIP proxy. It will then determine whether to initiate ICE restart under the following conditions:</p>
<p/>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
  <li>After re-establishing connection with the SIP proxy and before sending new offer to initiate ICE restart if Mobility using ICE is successful then stop sending the new offer.</li>
  <li>After successful negotiation of updated offer/answer to initiate ICE restart, proceed with ICE restart and stop Mobility using ICE if ICE checks are in the Running/Failed states or ICE is partially successful and not yet reached ICE complete state. It's not implementation friendly to have to two checks running in parallel. ICE restart can re-use partial successful ICE connectivity check results from Mobility using ICE if required as optimization.</li>

The ICE endpoint will generate STUN Binding Response containing the MOBILE-SUPPORT attribute and the ICE agent takes role of controlled agent. If STUN Request containing the MOBILITY-EVENT attribute is received before the endpoint is in the ICE Completed state, it should be silently discarded.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.1.p.2">The agent remembers the highest-priority nominated pairs in the Valid list for each component of the media stream, called the previous selected pairs before removing all the selected candidate pairs from the Valid List .

<p/>

<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">The ICE endpoints can maintain the relayed candidates active even when not actively used, so that relayed candidates can be tried if ICE connectivity checks using other candidate types fails. The ICE agent will have to create permissions in the TURN server for the remote relayed candidate IP addresses and perform the following steps:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>The ICE agent will keep the relayed candidates alive using Refresh transaction, as described in <a href="#RFC5766">[RFC5766]</a>.</li>
  <li>When the endpoint IP address changes due to mobility, the ICE agent will refresh it's allocation with TURN server using <a href="#refresh">Section 5.2</a>.</li>
  <li>The ICE agent will pair local and remote relayed candidates for connectivity checks when performing the steps in <a href="#Mob">Section 3.1</a>.</li>
  <li>If the ICE connectivity check succeeds only with local and remote relayed candidates, it suggests that either other peer is roaming at the same time or is behind Address-Dependent Filtering NAT. The ICE agent adds the relayed candidate pair to the valid list and marks it as selected. The ICE agent can now send media using the newly selected relayed candidate pair. The Mobile device must re-establish connection with SIP proxy, issue an updated offer indicating ICE restart so that media can switched to higher-priority candidate pairs.</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">This approach assists Mobility using ICE to succeed but brings in additional overhead of maintaining relayed candidates.In case of Simultaneous Mobility, host candidates can change for both the endpoints by maintaining relayed candidates and using <a href="#MTURN">Section 5</a> media session can be established using the relayed candidate pair.</p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.5"><a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#MTURN" id="MTURN">Mobility using TURN</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">To achieve mobility, a TURN client should be able to retain an allocation on the TURN server across changes in the client IP address as a consequence of movement to other networks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">When the client sends the initial Allocate request to the TURN server, it will also include the new STUN attribute MOBILITY-TICKET (with zero length value), which indicates that the client is capable of mobility and desires a ticket. The TURN server provisions a ticket that is sent inside the new STUN attribute MOBILITY-TICKET in the Allocate Success response to the client. The ticket will be used by the client when it wants to refresh the allocation but with a new client IP address and port. It also ensures that the allocation can only be refreshed this way by the same client. When a client's IP address changes due to mobility, it presents the previously obtained ticket in a Refresh Request to the TURN server. If the ticket is found to be valid, the TURN server will retain the same relayed address/port for the new IP address/port allowing the client to continue using previous channel bindings -- thus, the TURN client does not need to obtain new channel bindings. Any data from external peer will be delivered by the TURN server to this new IP address/port of the client. The TURN client will continue to send application data to its peers using the previously allocated channelBind Requests.</p>

With TLS session resumption, this consumes 1 round trip. If TLS session resumption is not available, a full TLS handshake consumes 2 round trips.

<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">A mobility event only occurs after both ICE endpoints have exchanged their ICE information. Thus, both username fragments are already known to both endpoints. Each endpoint contributes at least 24 bits of randomness to the ice-ufrag (Section 15.4 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>), which provides 48 bits of randomness. An off-path attacker would have to guess those 48 bits to cause the endpoints to perform HMAC-SHA1 validation of the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.2">An attacker on the path between the ICE endpoints will see both ice-ufrags, and can cause the endpoints to perform HMAC-SHA1 validation by sending messages from any IP address.</p>

<p/>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A.1">A.1.</a> <a href="#reuse" id="reuse">Presence of other interfaces in Valid list</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.1">This technique is optional and only relevant if there is a host policy to maintain unused candidates on other interfaces using the steps in <a href="#keep">Appendix A.2.1</a>. ICE Agent can maintain unused candidates on other interfaces if it detects that it is behind Address-Dependent Filtering NAT or Firewall. ICE Agent can detect NAT, Firewall behaviour using the procedure explained in <a href="#RFC5780">[RFC5780]</a>. When the interface currently being used for media communication becomes unavailable. If other interfaces are available and local candidates from these interfaces are already present in the valid list then ICE endpoint will perform the following steps:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>The ICE endpoint based on the locally configured host policy preferences, will select a interface whose candidates are already present in the valid list.</li>
  <li>The ICE endpoint clears all the pairs in the valid list containing the IP addresses from the interface that become unavailable.</li>
  <li>The ICE endpoint initiates ICE connectivity checks on the selected interface. The ICE endpoint acts as controlling agent and MUST include MOBILITY-EVENT attribute to signal mobility event and SHOULD also include the USE-CANDIDATE attribute to signal an aggressive nomination (see Section 2.6 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>). When all components have a nominated pair in the valid list, media can begin to flow using the highest priority nominated pair.</li>
  <li>The ICE endpoint will re-establish connection with the SIP proxy. Once ICE connectivity checks for all of the media streams are completed, the controlling ICE endpoint follows the procedures in Section 11.1 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, specifically to send updated offer if the candidates in the m and c lines for the media stream (called the DEFAULT CANDIDATES) do not match ICE's SELECTED CANDIDATES (also see Appendix B.9 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.A.1.p.3">The ICE endpoint after Mobility using ICE is successful can issue an updated offer indicating ICE restart if higher priority interface becomes available.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.A.1.1.p.1">The ICE endpoint that receives ICE Mobility Event will perform the steps in <a href="#recvMob">Section 3.1.1</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A.2">A.2.</a> Losing an Interface</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.p.1">When an interface is lost, the SDP MAY be updated, so that the remote ICE host does not waste its efforts with connectivity checks to that address, as those checks will fail. Because it can be argued that this is merely an optimization, and that the interface loss might be temporary (and soon regained), and that ICE has reasonable accommodation for candidates where connectivity checks timeout, this specification does not strongly encourage updating the SDP to remove a lost interface.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.p.2">Likewise, this specification recommends that ICE candidate addresses in valid list be maintained actively, subject to the host's policy. For example, battery operated hosts have a strong incentive to not maintain NAT binding for server reflexive candidates learnt through STUN Binding Request, as the maintenance requires sending periodic STUN Binding Indication. As another example, a host that is receiving media over IPv6 may not want to persist with keeping a NATted IPv4 mapping alive (because that consumes a NAT mapping that could be more useful to a host actively utilizing the mapping for real traffic).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.p.3">Note: this differs from Section 8.3 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, which encourages abandoning unused candidates.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.2.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A.2.1">A.2.1.</a> <a href="#keep" id="keep">Keeping unused candidates in the valid list active</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.1.p.1">ICE endpoint subject to host policy can continue performing ICE connectivity checks using candidates from other interfaces on the host even after ICE is complete. If valid list contains unused candidate pairs from other interfaces and one of these interfaces can be selected to send to media in case the existing interface used for media is unavailable then ICE endpoint can keep the unused candidate pairs from other interface{s} alive by sending keepalives every NN seconds. It is recommended to only keep host/server-reflexive candidates active in the valid list and not the relayed candidates.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.2.1.1"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A.2.1.1">A.2.1.1.</a> Sending keep alive requests</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.1.1.p.1">Application Mechanism for Keeping Alive the NAT Mappings Associated with RTP / RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Flows <a href="#RFC6263">[RFC6263]</a> describes various reasons for doing keepalives on inactive streams and how to keep NAT mapping alive.  However this specification requires some additional functionality associated with the keepalives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.1.1.p.2">STUN binding requests MUST be used as the keepalive message instead of the STUN Binding indication as specified in <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>. This is to ensure positive peer consent from the remote side that the candidate pair is still active and in future mobility can be achieved using the steps in <a href="#reuse">Appendix A.1</a> . The request must include the MOBILITY-SUPPORT attribute. If the STUN binding response matches a pair in the checklist then that candidate pair should be kept in the list. If the STUN transaction fails then the candidate pair will be removed from valid list.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.A.2.1.2"><a href="#rfc.appendix.A.2.1.2">A.2.1.2.</a> Receiving keep alive requests</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.A.2.1.2.p.1">Upon receiving a STUN binding request containing a MOBILITY-SUPPORT attribute even when ICE processing is in the Completed state, the ICE endpoint will add this pair to the valid list if not already present and generate STUN Binding Response containing the MOBILE-SUPPORT attribute.</p>
