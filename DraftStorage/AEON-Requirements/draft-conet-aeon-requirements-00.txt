       Application Enabled Collaborative Networking Requirements
                    draft-conet-aeon-requirements-00

Abstract

   Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
   many application providers and network operators.  Historically, this
   functionality has been implemented to the extent possible using
   heuristics, which inspect and infer flow characteristics.  But many
   application flows in current usages are dynamic, adaptive, time-
   bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer, asymmetric, used on multipurpose
   devices, and have different priorities depending on direction of
   flow, user preferences, and other factors.  Any combination of these
   properties renders heuristic based techniques less effective and may
   result in compromises to application security or user privacy.  The
   document states requirements for a solution that enables
   identification and treatment of application flows without suffering
   the limitations that plague existing solutions.

1.  Introduction

   Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
   many application providers and network operators.  The problems faced
   by existing solutions that try to provide such visibility and to
   enable appropriate treatment of application flows are described in
   detail in [I-D.conet-aeon-problem-statement].

   As the IETF establishes default behaviors that thwart pervasive
   surveillance (e.g.  [RFC7258]), it will be important to provide
   mechanisms for applications that want to have the network provide
   differential flow treatment for their data.  The intent is to have
   applications protect the contents of their flows, yet have the
   ability to opt-in to information exchanges that provide a more
   precise allocation of network resources and thus a better user
   experience.  The document provide a complete set of requirements for
   such a solution.

2.  Terminology

   The section clarifies the intended meaning of specific terms used
   within this document.

   o  Application: An instance of an application running on end user's
      device, such as a web application running on an laptop or a mobile
      application running on a mobile device.

   o  Flow characteristics: Characteristics of individual application
      flows, such as tolerance to delay, loss, or jitter, anticipated
      average or maximum rate, relative priority with respect to the
      application's other flows, etc.  Examples of individual
      application flows include an audio flow, a video flow, a data
      flow, etc.

   o  Network node: A network elements, such as a router, switch,
      wireless access point, firewall, etc., that is in the path of one
      or more of an application's flows.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements

   Rather than encourage independent, protocol specific solutions to
   this problem, this document advocates a protocol and application
   independent information model and individual data models that can be
   applied in a consistent fashion across a variety of protocols to
   enable explicit communication between applications and the networks
   on which they are used.  The requirements are:

   Req-1:  MUST provide a mechanism for applications to explicitly
      signal their flow characteristics for individual application flows
      to the network.

   Req-2:  MUST provide network nodes visibility to application flow
      characteristics

   Req-3:  MUST provide mechanism for network nodes to contribute to
      application flow descriptions.

   Req-4:  MUST provide mechanism for applications to receive resulting
      flow descriptions as feedback from the network.  This feedback is
      not a guarantee nor an allocation of network resources.  Rather,
      it communicates anticipated ability of the network node to
      accommodate the corresponding flow.

   Req-5:  MUST complement existing heuristic based mechanisms.  Such
      mechanisms are used in many networks and SHOULD continue to work
      as portions of applications and networks nodes are enabled with
      functionality provided by this solution.

   Req-6:  MUST provide visibility for both directions of a flow,
      including flows that cross administrative boundaries.

   Req-7:  MUST provide mechanism to authenticate and authorize
      endpoints/applications to signal flow characteristics, including
      3rd party authentication and authorization for over-the-top (OTT)
      applications.

   Req-8:  MUST provide mechanism for integrity protection and replay
      protection of messages exchanged between the application and the
      network.

   Req-9:  MUST provide mechanism for applications to opt-out of any
      explicit signaling of their flow characteristics to the network.

   Req-10:  MUST provide mechanism for information signaled by
      applications to be repeated over time to accommodate changes in
      network routing.

   Req-11:  MUST provide mechanism for information signaled by
      applications to change over time and in a timely manner in
      response to changes in application operation.

   Req-12:  MUST provide mechanism for feedback provided by network
      nodes to change over time and in a timely manner in response to
      changes in network conditions.

   Req-13:  SHOULD provide mechanism for application flow
      characteristics to be propagated to all network nodes.

   Req-14:  MUST NOT dramatically affect the performance of
      participating network nodes and other network infrastructure
      propagating the information.

   Req-15:  MUST be applicable for both IPv4 and IPv6 deployments.

   Req-16:  SHOULD reuse or extend existing IETF standard protocols
      where possible.

   Req-17:  MUST provide considerations for protection against denial of
      service attacks.
