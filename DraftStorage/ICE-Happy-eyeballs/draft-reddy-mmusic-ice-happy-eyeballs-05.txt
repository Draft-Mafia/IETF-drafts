1.  Introduction

   There is a need to introduce fairness in the handling of connectivity
   checks sent on different IP address families in dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
   ICE scenarios.  Section 4.1.2.1 of ICE [RFC5245] points to [RFC3484]
   for prioritizing among the different IP families.  [RFC3484] is
   obsoleted by [RFC6724] but following the recommendations from the
   updated RFC will still lead to prioritization of IPv6 over IPv4 with
   the same candidate type.  There can be a lot of ICE candidates
   belonging to one address family which results in user-noticeable
   setup delays if the path for that address family is broken.

   To avoid such user-noticeable delays when the IPv6 path or IPv4 path
   is broken, this specification encourages earlier checking of the
   other address family.  Introducing IP address family fairness into
   ICE connectivity checks will lead to more sustained IPv6 deployment
   (so users will no longer have an incentive to disable IPv6), which
   incurs only a small penalty for the IPv4 connectivity checks.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses terminology defined in [RFC5245].

2.  Improving ICE Dual-stack Fairness

   Candidates SHOULD be prioritized such that a long sequence of
   candidates belonging to the same address family be interleaved with
   candidates from the alternate IP family.  For example, promoting IPv4
   candidates in the presence of many IPv6 addresses such that an IPv4
   address candidate is always present after a small sequence of IPv6
   addresses.  This makes ICE connectivity checks more responsive to
   failures of an address family by reordering the candidates such that

   IPv6 and IPv4 candidates get a fair chance during connectivity
   checks.

   An ICE agent can choose an algorithm or a technique of its choice to
   ensure the resulting checklists have a fair interleaved mix of IPv4
   and IPv6 address families.  Modifying the checklist directly can lead
   to uncoordinated local and remote checklists that result in ICE
   taking longer to complete.  The best approach is to modify the
   formula for calculating the candidate priority value.
   Section Section 3 discusses this in greater detail.

3.  Compatibility

   ICE [RFC5245] section 4.1.2 states that the formula in section
   4.1.2.1 SHOULD be used.  The fomula is as follows:

     priority = (2^24)*(type preference) +
                (2^8)*(local preference) +
                (2^0)*(256 - component ID)


   ICE [RFC5245] section 4.1.2.2 have guidelines for how the type
   preference value should be chosen.  Instead of having one static
   value for IPv4 and one static value for IPv6 type of addresses, it is
   possible to choose this value dynamically in such a way that IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses would have ended up interleaved in a list where the
   candidates where sorted by priority.

   The local and remote agent can have different algorithms for choosing
   the type preference value without any impact on coordination between
   the local and remote checklist.

   The checklist is made up by candidate pairs.  A candidate pair is two
   candidates paired up and given a candidate pair priority as described
   in [RFC5245] section 5.7.2.  Using the pair priority formula:

     pair priority = 2^32*MIN(G,D) + 2*MAX(G,D) + (G>D?1:0)


   Where G is the candidate provided by the controlling agent and D the
   priority provided by the controlled agent.  Ensures that the local
   and remote checklists are coordinated.

   Interoperability with agents that does not support ICE Happy Eyeballs
   are supported in the same way as two agents with different ICE Happy
   Eyeballs candidate priority algorithms.  It is the controlling agent
   that have most impact on how the checklist is sorted due to the
   formula above.  If the controlling agent does not support any form of
   ICE Happy Eyeball algorithm, the effect is standard ICE behaviour

4.  IANA Considerations

   None.

5.  Security Considerations

   STUN connectivity check using MAC computed during key exchanged in
   the signaling channel provides message integrity and data origin
   authentication as described in section 2.5 of [RFC5245] apply to this
   use.
