STUN message handling in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back
                          User Agents (B2BUAs)
                     draft-ram-straw-b2bua-stun-00

Abstract

   SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) are often envisaged to be on
   the media path, rather than just intercepting signaling.  This means
   that B2BUAs often act on the media path leading to separate media
   legs that the B2BUA correlates and bridges together.  When acting on
   the media path, the B2BUAs are likely to receive packets like STUN
   that are part of the ICE connectivity checks and keep-alive
   mechanisms apart from the media packets.  It is critical that the
   B2BUAs handle these STUN messages properly.

   This document defines the proper behavior B2BUAs should follow when
   STUN messages are sent on the media path.

1.  Introduction

   Protocols using offer/answer like the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [RFC3261] are difficult to operate through Network Address
   Translators (NAT) because they carry IP addresses within their
   messages.  To remedy this, an extension to SDP [RFC4566], called
   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been defined
   [RFC5245].  ICE defines procedures by which agents gather a
   multiplicity of addresses, include all of them in an SDP offer or
   answer, and then use peer-to-peer connectivity checks using Session
   Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389]  to determine a valid
   candidate pair for each media stream.

   In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path
   between the originating and final terminating endpoints.  These SIP
   entities, as described in [RFC7092], modify SIP headers, SDP bodies
   and also are likely to be on the media path.  Such entities, when
   present in the media path, are likely to do several things.  For
   example, some B2BUAs modify parts of the SDP body (like IP address,
   port) and subsequently modify the transport headers as well.  There
   are other types of B2BUAs that completely modify the transport
   payload.  (e.g., a media transcoder).

   Section 18.6 of ICE [RFC5245] explains about two different behaviors
   when B2BUAs are present.  Some B2BUAs are likely to remove all the
   SDP ICE attributes before sending the SDP across to the other side.
   Consequently, the call will appear to both endpoints as if the other
   side doesn't support ICE.  There are other types of B2BUAs that
   passes the ICE attributes without modification, yet modifies the
   default destination for media (contained in the m= and c= lines and
   rtcp attribute), this will be detected as an ICE mismatch, and ICE
   processing is aborted for the call.  This behavior of disabling ICE
   is not always desirable especially when one of the endpoints is
   behind a NAT.

   [RFC7092] describes three different categories of such B2BUAs,
   according to the level of activities performed on the media plane:

      A B2BUA that acts as a simple media relay effectively unaware of
      anything that is transported and only modifies the transport
      header (could be UDP/IP) of the media packets.

      A B2BUA that performs a media-aware role.  It inspects and
      potentially modifies RTP or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) headers;
      but it does not modify the payload of RTP/RTCP.

      A B2BUA that performs a media-termination role and operates at the
      media payload layer, such as RTP/RTCP payload (e.g., a
      transcoder).

   When such a B2BUA operating on a media plane is involved a call
   between two endpoints that performs ICE, then it SHOULD follow the
   behavior mentioned in this specification.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following generalized terms are defined in [RFC3261], Section 6.

      B2BUA: A SIP Back-to-Back User Agent, which is the logical
      combination of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client
      (UAC).

      UAS: A SIP User Agent Server.

      UAC: A SIP User Agent Client.

   All of the pertinent B2BUA terminology and taxonomy used in this
   document is based on [RFC7092].

3.  Media Plane B2BUAs

3.1.  Overview

   When one or both the endpoints are behind NAT, and there is a B2BUA
   between the endpoints, it is desirable to have the B2BUA support ICE
   or at the minimum support ICE LITE functionality as described in
   [RFC5245].  Such B2BUAs MUST implement ICE and STUN and handle STUN
   messages sent by the endpoints on the media path.  B2BUAs MUST use
   the mechanism described in section 5.1.2 of [RFC5764] to demultiplex
   STUN packets that arrive on the RTP/RTCP port.

   The subsequent sections describes the behavior B2BUA's MUST follow
   for handling STUN messages.  A B2BUA MAY always terminate ICE and
   thus have two ICE contexts with either endpoints.  A B2BUA MAY also
   be in ICE passthrough mode and passes across the candidate list from
   one endpoint to the other side.  The below sections describes the
   behaviors for these two cases.

3.2.  ICE termination with B2BUA

   A B2BUA that wishes to be alway in the media path MUST follow the
   below steps when it receives a SDP with ICE semantics.

      When a B2BUA receives a SDP with ICE semantics it MUST respond
      with a SDP having ICE candidates.  A B2BUA MAY be in ICE lite mode
      as described in section 2.7 of [RFC5245] in which case it MUST
      send a=ice-lite and MUST include host candidates for each
      component of each media stream.

      If the B2BUA supports full ICE, then it MAY include candidates of
      different types for each component of each media stream in the SDP
      offer/answer.

      A B2BUA when it sends out SDP, it MUST advertise support for ICE
      and MAY include candidates of different types for each component
      of each media stream.

      The B2BUA MUST generate new username, password values for ice-
      ufrag and ice-pwd attributes when it sends out the SDP and MUST
      NOT propagate the ufrag/password values it received in the
      incoming SDP.  This ensures that the short-term credentials used
      for both the legs are different.  B2BUA terminates the STUN
      message on each leg, generates new STUN message using new
      cryptographically-random [RFC4086] STUN transaction ID and
      computes the message integrity for STUN messages using the new
      credentials.

      The B2BUA MUST generate and/or respond to ICE connectivity checks
      after offer/answer is completed.

     Figure 1: INVITE with SDP having ICE and with a Media Plane B2BUA

   Above figure shows a sample call flow with two endpoints Alice and
   Bob doing ICE and a B2BUA handing STUN messages from both the
   endpoints.  For the sake of brevity the entire ICE SDP attributes are
   not shown.  Also the STUN messages exchanged as part of ICE
   connectivity checks are not shown.  Key steps to note from the call
   flow are:

   1.  Alice sends an INVITE with SDP having ICE candidates.

   2.  B2BUA modifies the received SDP from Alice by removing the
       received candidates, gathers its own candidates, updates ice-
       ufrag, ice-password attributes with new username, password values
       and forwards the INVITE (3) to Bob.

   3.  Bobs responds(5) to the INVITE with his own list of candidates.

   4.  B2BUA responds to the INVITE from Alice with SDP having B2BUA's
       candidate list.  B2BUA would also convey ice-ufrag, ice-password
       attributes with new username, password values in the 200 OK
       response(6).

   5.  ICE Connectivity checks happen between Alice and B2BUA in step 9.
       Depending on whether the B2BUA supports ICE or ICE lite it will
       follow the appropriate procedures mentioned in [RFC5245].  The
       B2BUA MUST process the STUN request sent by Alice and respond to
       the same without forwarding it to the other side (Bob).

   6.  ICE Connectivity checks also happen between Bob and B2BUA in step
       10.  Step 9, 10 happens in parallel and STUN messages on each
       side MUST NOT be forwarded to the other side by the B2BUA.

   7.  Media flows between Alice and Bob via B2BUA (Step 13, 14).

   8.  STUN keepalives would be used between Alice and B2BUA (step 15)
       and between Bob and B2BUA (step 16) to keep NAT, Firewall
       bindings alive.

   Since there are two independent ICE agents on either side of the
   B2BUA it is possible that ICE checks will conclude on one side before
   concluding on the other side.  This could result in an ongoing media
   session for one end, while the other is still being set up.  Any such
   media received by the B2BUA would continue to be sent to the other
   side on the default candidate address (that was sent in c= line).

3.3.  STUN/ICE passthrough with B2BUA

   When ICE is used by endpoints for determining a valid pair to send
   media and if a B2BUA is in the media path using the approach
   mentioned in previous sections would always lead to media flowing
   through B2BUA.  To avoid this situation, a B2BUA can follow the steps
   mentioned below.  Note if the B2BUA is terminating media (like
   Transcoder e.t.c) it MUST terminate ICE as well.

      When a B2BUA receives a incoming SDP with ICE semantics it copies
      the received candidate list, adds its own candidate list and then
      sends the outgoing SDP.

      The B2BUA MUST propagate the ufrag/password values it received in
      the incoming SDP to the outbound SDP as it is.

      After offer/answer is complete, the endpoints would have both the
      B2BUA's candidate list and the peer endpoints candidate list.  It
      would then use ICE procedures described in [RFC5245] to select a
      candidate pair for sending and receiving media streams.

   1.  Alice sends an INVITE with SDP having ICE candidates.

   2.  B2BUA propagates the received candidate list in SDP from Alice
       after adding its own candidate list.  B2BUA also propagates the
       received ice-ufrag, ice-password attributes from Alice and
       forwards in the INVITE (3) to Bob. In this example call flow,the
       B2BUA does not change the c-line IP in the received SDP and
       propagates the received IP address from Alice in C-line as is to
       Bob. However it is possible that a B2BUA puts its IP address in
       the C-line to indicate that as a preferred address before
       forwarding the INVITE.

   3.  Bobs responds(5) to the INVITE with his own list of candidates.

   4.  B2BUA responds to the INVITE from Alice with SDP having B2BUA's
       candidate list and the candidate list received from Bob. B2BUA
       would also propagate the received ice-ufrag, ice-password
       attributes from Bob in step (5) to Alice in the 200 OK
       response(6).

   5.  ICE Connectivity checks happen between Alice and Bob in step 9.
       ICE Connectivity checks also happens between Alice and B2BUA and
       Bob and B2BUA as shown in step 10, 11.  Step 9, 10, 11 MAY happen
       in parallel.  In this example Alice and Bob concludes ICE with a
       candidate pair that enables them to send media directly between
       them.

   6.  Media flows between Alice and Bob in Step 12.

   7.  STUN keepalives would be used between Alice and Bob (step 13) to
       keep NAT, Firewall bindings alive.

3.4.  STUN interaction with DTLS-SRTP in B2BUA

   [I-D.ram-straw-b2bua-dtls-srtp]describes the behavior of B2BUAs when
   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] is used by Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   [RFC3261] endpoints to establish a Secure Real-time Transport
   Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] session.  When ICE is used by such
   endpoints, it needs to take care of the following things:

      If Aggressive nomination is used in ICE, DTLS session is setup as
      soon as connectivity check for a media stream is complete.  If a
      different candidate pair is selected after ICE conclusion, then
      the previously setup DTLS session could be re-used using session
      resumption as mentioned in Appendix B of [RFC5764].

    Figure 3: INVITE with SDP having both ICE and DTLS and with a Media
                                relay B2BUA

   Below call flows shows a example of how a B2BUA works when both DTLS
   and ICE are used.  In this example, the B2BUA is in media relay mode
   for DTLS session and passes across the fingerprint attribute in SDP
   from Alice to Bob without any modification.

   The above example shows a call flow where endpoints use ICE and
   DTLS..  The example here shows an early offer call, however the same
   is applicable for delay media scenarios as well.  For the sake of
   brevity the entire candidate list is not shown.  After ICE concludes,
   DTLS session is setup.  DTLS session can be re-used across multiple
   media streams using session resumption.  DTLS-SRTP RFC also allows
   peers to establish multiple DTLS sessions, refer to Appendix of
   [RFC5764] for alternative approach.

3.5.  STUN Handling in B2BUA with Forked Signaling

   B2BUA's may receive multiple answers for an outbound INVITE due to a
   downstream proxy forking the INVITE to multiple targets.  It is
   possible that each of these responses have ICE parameters signaled in
   the SDP.  In such cases, the B2BUA SHOULD take care of doing ICE
   connectivity checks for each of the forked target.
