    <abstract>
      <t>Application Enabled Collaborative Networking (AECON) discusses the
      need for mechanisms using which applications signal the network to
      provide differential flow treatment for application data traffic. The
      intent is to have applications protect the content of their flows, yet
      have the ability to opt-in information exchanges that provide a more
      precise allocation of network resources and thus get better user
      experience. This document discusses security implications of such a
      solution.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
      many application providers and network operators. The problems faced by
      existing solutions that try to provide such visibility to enable
      appropriate treatment of application flows are described in detail in
      <xref target="I-D.conet-aeon-problem-statement"></xref>.</t>

      <t>As the IETF establishes default behaviors that thwart pervasive
      surveillance (e.g. <xref target="RFC7258"></xref>), it will be important
      to provide secure mechanism for applications that want to have the
      network provide differential flow treatment for their data.</t>

      <t>It is essential that this model considers security and privacy
      implications to ensure that false claims and unwarranted differentiated
      treatment for flows are disallowed. For example, the solution should
      ensure that network be able to trust the application/user/end-point
      before providing differential treatment. Similarly an application or a
      client must be able to trust the network before providing flow
      information. </t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Notational Conventions">
      <t>TODO</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="AECON" title="AECON approach">
      <t>The goal of AECON is to offer mechanisms that allow applications to
      request network services for better user experience. AECON approach
      towards finding solutions to the use cases described in the <xref
      target="I-D.conet-aeon-use-cases"></xref> includes the following
      steps:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Identify the protocol(s) best fit to solve the problem depending
          on the use case, application that is going to use it, connectivity
          and network type, trust level present in the running environment,
          etc.</t>

          <t>Provide the specification on how the protocol is used to solve
          the problem and describe the required extensions.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Protocol selection">
        <t>Applications continue to grow in number, type and diversity. They
        are running on a multitude of host types and Operating Systems,
        following different delivery models (native, web, cloud). Many use
        peer-to-peer or client-server models and open standard protocols for
        establishing connectivity. Applications run in various environments
        like enterprise, home network, home automation, factory floors,
        hospital setting, utilities etc. Devices hosting the applications may
        connect to the network in various ways, using different technologies,
        having multiple interfaces to the same or different network devices,
        connecting over cable, DSL, FTTH, wireless etc. In order to operate in
        these environments, some applications already run lightweight
        client-server network protocols (e.g. STUN to discover public
        addresses when behind NAT devices, PCP to create explicit port
        forwarding rules etc).</t>

        <t>The AECON solution requires a protocol to be used for signaling the
        application flow characteristics to the network and getting feedback
        from the network. A few existing protocols with new extensions can be
        considered:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Client-server network protocol: PCP with flow meta data
            extensions: Handles both TCP and UDP flows.</t>

            <t>On-path application protocol: STUN with flow meta data
            extensions between hosts. Handles UDP flows.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Flow Metadata Handling">
        <t>In AECON, applications signal the flow characteristics to the
        network. The network responds back to applications with the result of
        processing the request. Depending on its nature and needs, the
        application may request different flow characteristics. As the
        application requirements change, the flow characteristics communicated
        to the network may be revised. When network state changes or when
        different events occur, if needed, network element sends update that
        the flow can no longer be accommodated. For example an application may
        send at startup certain bandwidth, delay and jitter requirements. The
        network performs bandwidth accounting against the matching service
        class and sends an acknowledgment to the application. </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec_overview" title="Security overview">
      <t>As described earlier, it is essential that the AECON solution
      considers all security implications and the mechanism/protocol that is
      chosen for the solution complies to the required security requirements.
      This section lists a set of basic security requirements that any such
      mechanism/protocol must support.</t>

      <section title="Mutual authentication">
        <t>A basic security requirement is that there must be a mechanism for
        mutual authentication between the application signaling flow
        information and the network entity that uses this flow information to
        provide differential treatment for flows. Without this, the solution
        is open for attacks with fake applications falsely claiming to be
        legitimate applications that require special treatment i.e. The
        network infrastructure is at risk of being misused. Should the network
        entity be spoofed, applications could be misled that the network has
        accommodated the requested flow characteristics.</t>

        <section title="Integrity protection">
          <t>Integrity protection is necessary to ensure that a man-in-middle
          device does not alter the signaling information, thus ensuring that
          the network receives the flow characteristics as sent by the client
          and the client receives flow characteristics accommodated by the
          network. Compromise in integrity could result in applications flows
          not receiving the intented treatment.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Replay Protection">
          <t>The mechanism should have replay protection i.e a network attack
          in which flow characteristics requested by the client and
          accommodated by the network is maliciously or fraudulently repeated
          or delayed. Security guarantees are not possible if the mechanism
          cannot detect and protect itself from replay attacks possibly as
          part of a masquerade attack by IP packet substitution.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Security with browser-based applications">
        <t>The basic assumption is that browser serves as the user's TRUSTED
        COMPUTING BASE (TCB). Any security property which the user wishes to
        have enforced must be ultimately guaranteed by the browser (or
        transitively by some property the browser verifies). Conversely, if
        the browser is compromised, then no security guarantees are possible.
        Browser must validate the flow characteristics signaled via a
        JavaScript (JS) API and discard any request seeking far more resources
        than actually required or requests far less resources but consumes far
        more resources than the requested flow characteristics.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Privacy">
        <t>An eavesdropping entity should not be able to glean any information
        that could leak privacy-related information like application name from
        the protocol signaling flow characteristics to the network.</t>
