STUN messages Handling in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back
                          User Agents (B2BUAs)
                     draft-ram-straw-b2bua-stun-00

Abstract

   SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) are often envisaged to also be
   on the media path, rather than just intercepting signalling.  This
   means that B2BUAs often act as media path leading to separate media
   legs that the B2BUA correlates and bridges together.  When acting on
   the media path, the B2BUAs are likely to receive packets like STUN
   apart from the media packets.  It is critical that the B2BUAs handle
   these STUN messages properly.

   This document defines the proper behaviour B2BUAs should follow when
   STUN is sent on the media path.

1.  Introduction

   Protocols using offer/answer like the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) [RFC3261]are difficult to operate through Network Address
   Translators (NAT).  Because their purpose is to establish a flow of
   media packets, they tend to carry IP addresses within their messages,
   which is known to be problematic through NAT.  To remedy this, an
   extension to SDP [RFC4566], called Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) has been defined [RFC5245].  ICE defines
   procedures by which agents gather a multiplicity of addresses,
   include all of them in an SDP offer or answer, and then use peer-to-
   peer Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389]
   connectivity checks to determine a valid address.

   In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path
   between the originating and final terminating endpoints.  These SIP
   entities, as described in [RFC7092], modify SIP and SDP bodies and
   also are likely to be on the media path.  Such entities, when present
   in the signaling/media path, are likely to do several things.  For
   example, some B2BUAs modify parts of the SDP body (like IP address,
   port) and subsequently modify the UDP headers as well.  There are
   other types of B2BUAs that completely modify the UDP payload.  (e.g.,
   a transcoder).

Internet-Draft         STUN handling in SIP B2BUA              June 2014


   Section 18.6 ICE [RFC5245] talks about two behaviours when B2BUAs are
   present.  Some B2BUAs are likely to remove all the SDP ICE attributes
   before sending the SDP across to the other side.  Consequently, the
   call will appear to both endpoints as if the other side doesn't
   support ICE.  However disabling ICE is not always desirable
   especially when one of the endpoints is behind a NAT.  There are
   other types of B2BUAs that just change m and/or c-lines in SDP before
   passing across the SDP to the other side.  In such a case the
   endpoints would generate a ICE mismatch and this MAY result in a call
   failure.

   When one or both the endpoints are behind NAT, and there is a B2BUA
   between the endpoints, it is desirable to have the B2BUA support ICE
   or at the minium support ICE LITE functionality as described in
   [RFC5245].  Such B2BUAs MUST implement ICE and STUN stack and handle
   STUN messages sent by the endpoints on the media path.  B2BUAs MUST
   use the mechanism described in section 5.1.2 of [RFC5764] to
   demultiplex STUN packets that arrive on the RTP/RTCP port.

   [RFC7092] describes three different categories of such B2BUAs,
   according to the level of activities performed on the media plane:

      A B2BUA that act as a simple media relay effectively unaware of
      anything that is transported and only modifies the UDP/IP header
      of the packets.

      A B2BUA that performs a media-aware role.  It inspects and
      potentially modifies RTP or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) headers;
      but it does not modify the payload of RTP/RTCP.

      A B2BUA that performs a media-termination role and operates at the
      media payload layer, such as RTP/RTCP payload (e.g., a
      transcoder).

   When such a B2BUA operating on a media plane is in a call between two
   endpoints that does ICE, it SHOULD follow the behaviour mentioned in
   the below sections.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following generalized terms are defined in [RFC3261], Section 6.

      B2BUA: A SIP Back-to-Back User Agent, which is the logical
      combination of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client
      (UAC).

      UAS: A SIP User Agent Server.

      UAC: A SIP User Agent Client.

   All of the pertinent B2BUA terminology and taxonomy used in this
   document is based on [RFC7092].

   It is assumed the reader is familiar with concepts of the STUN
   protocol [RFC5389], ICE [RFC5245] and the problems with NAT when
   applications use ephemeral ports.

3.  Media Plane B2BUAs

3.1.  Media Relay or Media aware or Media Termination

   A B2BUA operating on a media plane and is either a media relay or
   media aware or media termination B2BUA MUST follow the below steps
   when it receives a SDP with ICE semantics.

      When a B2BUA receives a SDP OFFER with ICE semantics it MUST
      respond with a SDP ANSWER having ICE candidates.  A B2BUA MAY be
      in ICE lite mode as described in section 2.7 of [RFC5245] in which
      case it MUST send a=ice-lite and MUST include host candidates for
      each media stream.

      If the B2BUA supports complete ICE, then it MAY include more than
      one candidate for each component of each media stream in the SDP
      answer.

      A B2BUA when it sends out a SDP with OFFER, it MUST advertise
      support for ICE and MAY include one or more candidates for each
      media stream.

      The B2BUA MUST generate a new ufrag/password when it sends out the
      SDP and MUST NOT pass across the ufrag/password it received in the
      incoming SDP.

      The B2BUA MUST implement ICE or ICE lite and be able to generate
      and/or respond to ICE connectivity checks with either of the
      endpoints after offer/answer is completed as per ICE procedures
      mentioned in [RFC5245].

   Above figure shows a sample call flow with two endpoints Alice and
   Bob doing ICE and a B2BUA handing STUN messages from both the
   endpoints.  For the sake of brevity the entire ICE SDP attributes are
   not shown.  Also the STUN messages exchanged as part of ICE
   connectivity checks are not shown.  Some key things to note from the
   call flow are:

   1.  Alice sends a INVITE with SDP offer having ICE candidates.

   2.  B2BUA removes the Alices candidates, gathers its own candidates,
       adds a new ufrag/password and forwards the INVITE (3) to Bob.
       Note depending on whether the B2BUA is ICE lite or ICE it will
       gather candidates.

   3.  Bobs responds(5) to the INVITE with his candidate list.

   4.  B2BUA responds to the INVITE from Alice with SDP having B2BUA's
       candidate list.  B2BUA would add a new ufrag/password (6) in the
       response.

   5.  Connectivity checks happen between Alice and B2BUA in step 9.
       Note depending on whether the B2BUA supports ICE or ICE lite it
       will follow the appropriate procedures mentioned in [RFC5245].
       The B2BUA MUST consume the STUN messages sent by Alice and
       respond to the same with out forwarding to the other side (Bob).

   6.  Connectivity checks also happen between Bob and B2BUA in step 10.
       Step 9, 10 happens in parallel and STUN messages on each side
       MUST NOT be forwarded to the other side by the B2BUA.

   7.  Once ICE is completed on each side, there MAY be a updated SIP
       offer/answer (steps 11 to 14).

   8.  After this media flows between Alice and Bob via B2BUA (Step 15).
       The B2BUA may be media relay or media aware or media termination
       device here.

   9.  ICE keep alives would be done between Alice and B2BUA (step 16)
       and between Bob and B2BUA (step 17).  The B2BUA MUST NOT forward
       the ICE keep-alive STUN binding indications from Alice to Bob or
       Vice-versa.

3.2.  STUN interaction with DTLS-SRTP in B2BUA

   (TODO: Add reference to DTLS-STRAW draft) describes the behaviour of
   B2BUAs when DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] is used by Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] endpoints to establish a Secure Real-time

   Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] session.  When ICE is used by
   such endpoints, it needs to take care of the following things:

      ICE MUST be completed for each media stream before DTLS session is
      setup.  Once ICE is completed, DTLS session is setup.

      If Aggressive nomination is used in ICE, DTLS session is setup as
      soon as connectivity check for a media stream is complete.  If a
      different candidate is selected after ICE conclusion, then the
      previously setup DTLS session is disconnected and a new session is
      setup.  Note that DTLS session setup uses same fingerprint for all
      media streams in a SDP.

      If ICE restart happens and new candidate gets nominated after ICE
      connectivity checks, the previously setup DTLS session is
      disconnected and a new DTLS session is setup for nominated
      candidate pair.

    Figure 2: INVITE with SDP having both ICE and DTLS and with a Media
                                Plane B2BUA

   Below call flows shows a example of how a B2BUA works with both DTLS
   and ICE are used.  In this example, the B2BUA is in media relay mode
   for DTLS session and passes across the fingerprint or password from
   Alice to Bob.

   The example above shows how ICE and DTLS can be sent together in
   session.  The example here shows a early offer call, however the same
   is applicable for delay media scenarios as well.  For the sake of
   brevity the entire candidate list is not shown.  Each endpoint MAY
   send one or more candidates for each component of each media line as
   per RFC 5245.  A B2BUA MAY also send one or more candidates.  If the
   B2BUA is in ICE lite mode, then it sends only one candidate (Host
   Candidate) Once offer/answer is completed, ICE connectivity would
   happen between Alice and B2BUA and B2BUA and Bob. If the B2BUA is ICE
   LITE mode, it will only respond to ICE connectivity checks.  After
   ICE concludes, DTLS session would be setup on the nominated ICE
   candidate. with Agressive nomination there MAY be multiple DTLS
   session setups possible, however once ICE is completed and a

   candidate pair is finally selected, DTLS session is setup for that
   pair.

3.3.  STUN Handling in B2BUA with Forked Signaling

   B2BUA's may receive multiple answers for an outbound INVITE due to a
   downstream proxy forking the INVITE to multiple targets.  It is
   possible that each of these responses have ICE negotiated in the SDP.
   In such cases, the B2BUA SHOULD take care of doing ICE connectivity
   checks for each of the forked target.
