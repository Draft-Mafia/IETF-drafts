    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides guidelines on how to make ICE <xref
      target="RFC5245"/> conclude faster in IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack scenarios
      where broken paths exist. This will lead to more sustained IPv6
      deployment as users will longer have an incentive to disable IPv6.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>There is a need to introduce more fairness in the handling of
      connectivity checks for different IP address families in dual-stack
      IPv4/IPv6 ICE scenarios. Section 4.1.2.1 of ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/>
      points to <xref target="RFC3484"/> for prioritizing among the different
      IP families. <xref target="RFC3484"/> is obsoleted by <xref
      target="RFC6724"/> but following the recommendations from the updated
      RFC will lead to prioritization of IPv6 over IPv4 for the same candidate
      type. Due to this, connectivity checks for candidates of the same type
      (HOST, RFLX, RELAY) are sent such that an IP address family is
      completely depleted before checks on the other address family are
      started. This results in user-noticeable setup delays if the path for
      the first address family is broken.</t>

      <t>To avoid such user-noticeable delays when either IPv6 path or IPv4
      path is broken, this specification encourages earlier checking of the
      other address family. Introducing IP address family fairness into ICE
      connectivity checks will lead to more sustained IPv6 deployment (so
      users will no longer have an incentive to disable IPv6), with only a
      small penalty for IPv4 connectivity checks.</t>

    <section title="Improving ICE Dual-stack Fairness">
      <t>Candidates SHOULD be prioritized such that a long sequence of
      candidates belonging to the same address family be interleaved with
      candidates from the alternate IP family. For example, promoting IPv4
      candidates in the presence of many IPv6 candidates such that an IPv4
      address candidate is always present after a small sequence of IPv6
      candidates i.e., reordering candidates such that IPv6 and IPv4
      candidates get a fair chance during the connectivity check phase. This
      makes ICE connectivity checks more responsive to failures of an address
      family.</t>

      <t>An ICE agent can choose an algorithm or a technique of its choice to
      ensure that the resulting check lists have a fair interleaved mix of
      IPv4 and IPv6 address families. Modifying the checklist directly can
      lead to uncoordinated local and remote checklists that result in ICE
      taking longer to complete. The best approach is to modify the formula
      for calculating the candidate priority value described in ICE <xref
      target="RFC5245"/> section 4.1.2.1.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="compability" title="Compatibility">
      <t>ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/> section 4.1.2 states that the formula in
      section 4.1.2.1 SHOULD be used. The formula is as follows:</t>

      <t><figure>
          <artwork align="right"><![CDATA[
     priority = (2^24)*(type preference) + 
                (2^8)*(local preference) + 
                (2^0)*(256 - component ID)
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>ICE <xref target="RFC5245"/> section 4.1.2.2 has guidelines for how
      the type preference value should be chosen. Instead of having a static
      value for IPv4 and a static value for IPv6 type of addresses, it is
      possible to choose this value dynamically in such a way that IPv4 and
      IPv6 addresses end up interleaved in a list where candidates where
      sorted by priority.</t>

      <t>The local and remote agent can have different algorithms for choosing
      the type preference value without any impact on coordination between the
      local and remote checklist.</t>

      <t>The checklist is made up by candidate pairs. A candidate pair is two
      candidates paired up and given a candidate pair priority as described in
      <xref target="RFC5245"/> section 5.7.2. Using the pair priority
      formula:</t>

      <t><figure>
          <artwork align="right"><![CDATA[
     pair priority = 2^32*MIN(G,D) + 2*MAX(G,D) + (G>D?1:0)
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>Where G is the candidate provided by the controlling agent and D the
      priority provided by the controlled agent. This ensures that the local
      and remote checklists are coordinated.</t>

      <t>Interoperability with agents that do not support ICE Happy Eyeballs
      is supported in the same way as two agents with different ICE Happy
      Eyeballs candidate priority algorithms. </t>

      <t>Based on candidate pair priority formula above, the end point that
      has promoted IPv4 cautiosly i.e. IPv4 lower in its list when compared to
      the other end point, will influence the candidate priority pairing due
      to (2^32*MIN(G,D)) in the formula. So essentially, even If one of the
      agents does not support a form of ICE Happy Eyeball algorithm, the
      effect is standard ICE behaviour.</t>
