      <section title="Firewall Traversal: Identification of new applications">
        <section title="Description of Problem">
          <t>Modern firewalls use application-layer gateways (ALGs) to perform
          policy enforcement. For example firewalls implement SIP-aware
          Application Layer Gateway function, which examines the SIP signaling
          and opens the appropriate pinholes for the RTP media. In particular
          firewall extracts media transport addresses, transport protocol and
          ports from session description and creates a dynamic mapping for
          media to flow through. This model will not work in the following
          cases: <list style="numbers">
              <t>Session signaling is end-to-end encrypted (say, using
              TLS).</t>

              <t>Firewall does not understand the session signaling protocol,
              or extensions to the protocol, used by the endpoints (e.g.
              WebRTC signaling protocols).</t>

              <t>Session signaling and media traverse different firewalls
              (e.g., signaling exits a network via one firewall whereas media
              exits a network via a different firewall).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>This problem can be addressed by the host getting authorization
          from the Application Server trusted by the network in order to
          install flows and associated actions (e.g., policies). PCP third
          party authorization (draft-wing-pcp-third-party-authz-01) solves
          this problem by associating the media session with the signaling
          session. This is done by sending a cryptographic token in the
          signaling which authorizes the firewall mapping for the media
          session.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="User Benefit">
          <t>New applications can be deployed in the Enterprise network at a
          faster rate. This mechanism can be used by any other Application
          Function trusted by the network to permit time-bound, encrypted,
          peer-to-peer traffic.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Operator Benefit">
          <t>Enterprise firewalls can enforce restrictive policies without the
          need to be enhanced to perform ALG on new applications. For example
          Enterprise firewall could have granular policies to permit
          peer-to-peer UDP media session only when the call is initiated using
          the selected WebRTC server (Dr. Good) it trusts and block others
          (Dr. Evil). PCP-aware firewalls can enforce such granular security
          policies without performing ALG on the session signaling
          protocols.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Flow characteristics provided by application">
          <t>The client signals request to create dynamic mappings to permit
          traffic, flow characteristics to prioritize the traffic along with
          cryptographic token.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Action taken by firewall as result of receiving flow characteristics">
          <t>The client signaled request to create dynamic mappings to permit
          traffic, flow characteristics to prioritize traffic will be compared
          with the token bound authorization data to determine if the client
          request can be honored or not.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Feedback provided by firewall">
          <t>Firewall matches the authorization data with what is requested in
          the request sent by the client. If the authorization sets match, the
          firewall honors the request made by the client. If the token is
          invalid or the request exceeds what is authorized by the token then
          firewall rejects the request with appropriate error response.</t>
