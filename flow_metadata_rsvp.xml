    <abstract>
      <t>This specification describes the use of the RSVP resource reservation
      protocol for signaling flow metadata attributes.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Flow Metadata attributes are elements that identify flow
      characteristics, such as the type of media carried by the flow (e.g.
      video), the service class, the application that originated the flow,
      etc. The technology that makes use of Flow Metadata and some of the
      attributes are defined in [ID-FMD-FRAMEWORK]. The flow attributes can be
      inspected by intermediate network nodes and policies may be applied to
      the flow or network analytics could be collected. This specification
      proposes the use of RSVP as signaling protocol to carry the Flow
      Metadata. A new object is defined to carry the Flow Metadata
      information. Two C-Type values are proposed for this object to allow for
      two possible encodings.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Flow Metadata Object">
      <t>This specification defines a new RSVP object with Class-Num from the
      0x11bbbbbb range. The object can be inserted in Path, PathErr (?) and
      PathTear messages for IPv4 and IPv6 sessions (i.e. Path messages with
      SESSION Class = 1 and SENDER_TEMPLATE Class = 11). Metadata object
      SHOULD appear only once in the message.</t>

      <t>The object definition is given in Section 2.1 while the details of
      processing are covered in Section 2.2</t>

      <section title="FLOW_METADATA Class ">
        <t>FLOW_METADATA Class = 234</t>

        <t>Protocol Independent FLOW_METADATA Object: Class = 234, C-Type =
        1</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The metadata attributes are encoded in IPFIX format, as
            described in [RFC5101], with the following restrictions when
            creating the object:<list style="symbols">
                <t>Options Template Record MUST NOT be present</t>

                <t>One and only one Template Record MUST be present</t>

                <t>One and only one Data Record MUST be included</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>An intermediate node that supports this specification SHOULD
            ignore any Options Template Record. It SHOULD only decode and
            process the first occurring Template and Data Records.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t/>

        <t>Protocol Independent FLOW_METADATA Object: Class = 234, C-Type =
        2</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The contents and encoding rules for this object are specified
            in [ID-FMD-FRAMEWORK] and [ID-FMD-ENCODE].</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing by a Non-Metadata Capable RSVP Router">
        <t>As described in RFC2205, a node that does not understand the
        Metadata object, should ignore but forward it, unexamined and
        unmodified. When received in Path or Resv messages should be saved
        with the corresponding state and forwarded in any refresh message
        resulting from that state.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Processing by a Metadata Capable RSVP Router">
        <t>The Metadata object may be inserted by the data flow initiating
        endpoint or network nodes along the path in the Path message only. The
        Metadata object MUST NOT be inserted in the Resv message by any
        implementation that conforms with this specification only. The means
        by which an implementation determines the content of the Metadata
        object is outside the scope of this document.</t>

        <t>Intermediate nodes that support this specification, decode the Flow
        Metadata information as indicated by the C-Type field only when
        received in Path message. Depending on the attributes, local
        configuration and policies, the node may take some actions. The
        Metadata attribute semantics are described in [I-D-FMD-FRAMEWORK]. The
        received Flow Metadata object is stored against the Path state. When a
        subsequent Path message is received with modified Metadata object, an
        intermediate node determines the attributes that have been removed,
        modified and/ or added by comparing the old and new objects, and takes
        appropriate actions.</t>

        <t>As a result of these actions, an intermediate node may add new
        attributes to the Metadata object recevied in the Path message and
        signal them downstream. It can also modify some of the attributes
        present in the Flow Metadata object. RSVP does not have any transport
        protocol specific restrictions and the exact set of attributes that
        can be inserted and modified by intermediate nodes is described in
        [I-D-FMD-FRAMEWORK]. Depending on local policies, an intermediate node
        may also remove some of the attributes received in the Metadata object
        of a Path message before forwarding downstream.</t>

        <t>An intermediate node that receives a Resv message with a Metadata
        Object SHOULD store the object against the sate and forward it
        unexamined and unmodified.</t>

        <t>[AZ = not sure if we should mention anything about the encoding
        when forwarded out wrt to the incoming. I can see that in general
        cases it should be the same, unless explicitly configured to do
        translation. Or instructed through other means.]</t>

        <t>The node that originates the Path message may do so for the sole
        purpose of signaling Metadata information only or also for requesting
        bandwidth reservation for the flow. In the former case, the node
        should include the SENDER_TSPEC object with the following fields (as
        defined by [RFC 2210]) set to 0:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Token Bucket Rate [r]</t>

            <t>Token Bucket Size [b]</t>

            <t>Peak Data Rate [p]</t>

            <t>Minimum Policed Unit [m]</t>
          </list></t>
